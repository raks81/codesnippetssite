#summary Usage of the manageprofiles.sh to create profiles

= Introduction =

This little article explains how a new WebSphere profile can be created using the command line manageprofile.sh script that is available in /opt/IBM/WebSphere/AppServer/bin folder. This is needed if you are working in a Unix environment and do not have an X system available. 


= Details =
The most basic flavor is to create a new profile with default settings. To get the help on default template use this command:

{{{
>./manageprofiles.sh -create -help -templatePath /opt/IBM/WebSphere/AppServer/profileTemplates/default
}}}

To create a new profile use this command:

{{{
>./manageprofiles.sh -create -templatePath /opt/IBM/WebSphere/AppServer/profileTemplates/default 
-profileName AppSrv02 -profilePath /opt/IBM/WebSphere/AppServer/profiles/AppSrv02
}}}

You can use other command line arguments for the profile template that were listed in the output of help command above.

*Note that all command line arguments are case sensitive*

You obviously need to replace the absolute paths in the commands (/opt/IBM/WebSphere/AppServer) above with the installation directory of your WebSphere.

Command to augment a profile is pretty similar. In the command below the newly created profile (AppSrv02) will be augmented with EJB3 fixpack for WAS 6.1:

{{{
manageprofiles.sh -augment -profileName AppSrv02 -templatePath /opt/IBM/WebSphere/AppServer/profileTemplates/EJB3/default.ejb3fep
}}}
