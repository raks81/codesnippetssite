= Introduction =

A simple javascript bookmark that will translate the current web page using Google Translate. The language is detected automatically by google. This has been tested only in IE 6 as of this writing. I am not sure how it would behave if the source URL is already escaped.


= Details =
Create a new bookmark and paste the code below as the URL field in the "Web Document" tab.

{{{
javascript:document.location.href="http://translate.google.co.in/translate?prev=hp&hl=en&js=y&u="+escape(document.location.href);
}}}
